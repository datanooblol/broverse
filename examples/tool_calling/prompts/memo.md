**Summary of Our Adventure:**

We've had an exciting adventure together, and I'd be happy to summarize it for you.

**The Story So Far:**

We started with Batman and Robin infiltrating the Gotham City Bank, where the Joker had set a trap to steal the Gotham Diamond. We navigated through the bank's security system, avoiding the Joker's goons and traps along the way.

**Key Moments:**

* We created a diversion at the bank's entrance to draw the goons away from the ventilation system.
* We used gadgets to disable the mercenaries guarding the vault.
* We discovered the Joker's trap and had to find an alternative way to open the vault.
* We used a resonance wave to disrupt the frequency controlling the vault's security system.
* We escaped the toxic gas released by the Joker and navigated the ventilation shaft to reach him.

**The Current Situation:**

We're currently in the ventilation shaft, trying to reach the Joker before he can escape with the Gotham Diamond. The final showdown is approaching, and we need to decide how to confront the Joker.
